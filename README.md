# 4chan-extension-
This is an extension I am working on that adds various different features to 4chan such as-
## Image hover previews with dynamic positioning:
When you check the hover preview box to activate it then hover your mouse over an image or video a preview will be created that is dynamically positioned to follow the users cursor with a set padding so it isnt directly on the cursor but will follow it left or right. Also contains logic to stop the image going off either side of the screen

## Grid of images:
When Image Grid link is pressed it will replace the thread with only images the user can change the amount of images displayed in the settings menu (limit of 10).
There is also functionality to go fullscreen when an image is clicked by default the user can change this in the settings menu to take them to the post in the thread that contains the image.

## Fullscreen Gallery:
This is a fullscreen image gallery that contains slideshow functionality toggled by the user checking the checkbox which also contains keybinds on the left and right arrow to scroll through media.

## Custom Keybinding and settings menu
Custom settings menu to allow users to define the keybinds they want and toggle various settings off and on. Users can also define the folder name that the images will be downloaded to and create their own custom keybinds to toggle various features easily without having to press the buttons that activate them.

## Batch downloading media from the thread:
Checkboxes are attached to images in the grid which if checked when the download button is hit will be added to the download list and this will happen in the background with no filedialog the files will also be named what they are on 4chan

## Expand All Media In Thread:
The expand all button will expand all media in the thread with 4chans own expansion logic so you dont have to go through the thread and click every image.
